        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <img src="images/pbl9.png">
        <div>
            <p>Hayao Miyazaki was born in Tôkyô on January 5, 1941. He started his career<br>
               in 1963 as an animator at the studio Toei Douga studio, and was subsequently<br>
               involved in many early classics of Japanese animation. From the beginning, he<br>
               commanded attention with his incredible incredible drawing ability and the<br> 
               seemingly endless stream of movie ideas he proposed.<br><br>

            In 1971, he moved to the A Pro studio with Isao Takahata, then to Nippon<br>
            Animation in 1973, where he was heavily involved in the World Masterpiece<br>
            Theater TV animation series for the next five years. In 1978, he directed<br>
            his first TV series, Future Boy Conan (1978) (Conan, The Boy in Future),<br>
            then moved to Tôkyô Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first movie, the <br>
            classic Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979). In 1984, he released<br>
            Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984).</p>

        <h2 class="h1">Cheng Liyue</h2>
        <p class="p1">“Watching animes have always been my thing and I always get excited whenever<br>
                      I see that Hayao Miyazaki is going to direct another anime. I find it difficult<br>
                      to express emotions but with movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki, they impact me<br>
                      emotionally more than the other animes, and even if I am crying cause of them,<br>
            I still love them.”<br><br>December 28, 2021</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Kaito Kenta</h2>
        <p class="p2">“I am a huge fan of Studio Ghibli, I think I have watched about 80% of all the<br>
                       anime movies or series made by the studio and I have noticed that those that<br>
                       were personally directed by Hayao Miayazaki just seems to be better, maybe it’s<br>
                       just cause of my preference or he's just simply that good.”<br><br>March 4, 2022</p>
